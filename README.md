**MASAKHANE** is an research effort for NLP for African languages that is OPEN SOURCE, CONTINENT-WIDE, DISTRIBUTED and ONLINE. This GitHub repository houses the data, code, results and research for building open baseline NLP results for African languages.

Website: [masakhane.io](https://masakhane.io)

## Goals

- **For Africa**: To build and facilitate a community of NLP researchers, connect and grow it, spurring and sharing further research, build helpful tools for applications in government, medicine, science and education, to enable language preservation and increase its global visibility and relevance. 

- **For NLP Research**: To build data sets and tools to facilitate NLP research on African languages, and to pose new research problems to enrich the NLP research landscape.

- **For the global researchers community**: To discover best practices for distributed research, to be applied by other emerging research communities.


## Progress

- Look at our submitted machine translation benchmarks [here](https://github.com/masakhane-io/masakhane-mt/blob/master/language_pairs.md)! Can't see your language? Please submit a benchmark!
- Check out our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.11529) to be published at AfricaNLP Workshop @ ICLR 2020
- Check out papers written by our participants [here](https://github.com/masakhane-io/masakhane-community/blob/master/publications.md)
- Find our more about our [current initiatives](https://github.com/masakhane-io/masakhane-community/blob/master/initiatives.md)
- Look at our list of [community documents](https://github.com/masakhane-io/masakhane-community/blob/master/community-documents.md)
- Read our [weekly meeting notes](https://github.com/masakhane-io/masakhane-community/tree/master/meetingsummaries)
- Follow our publication on [Medium](https://medium.com/masakhane)

## How can I contribute?

There are many ways to contribute to **MASAKHANE**.

1. **TRAIN A MODEL** - Contribute a trained model and related code for your language
2. **ANALYSIS** - Contribute analysis of data/models for any African languages. You do not need any technical experience for this! If you're a linguist, we can pair you up with a NLP practitioner and you can help contribute analysis
3. **DATA** - Help build or find datasets for your language
4. **DOCUMENTATION** - Help document our discussions, progress. This is VERY much needed. Or contribute to documentation of the base "notebook" that will improve the experience of others
5. **MENTORSHIP** - Provide advice or help tune models for their languages and datasets, or help people get started
6. **ADMIN** - Working with so many researchers can be quite a challenge! Help out with administrative tasks
7. **COMPUTE** - Help with infrastructure and compute! Do you have spare compute to donate? Let us know! We're always looking for more!
8. **BRAINSTORM** Join our weekly meetings, provide advice or ideas
9. **STORY-TELLING** - Tell our stories to the world by doing talks about the community, contributing to our [Medium publication](https://medium.com/masakhane), or engaging with media outlets
10. **MLOps & ML Engineering** - Do you enjoy delving into the MLOps side of machine learning? Are you a software developer looking to hone-in on your ML engineer abilities? Join us to help build tools to support out reproducability, data gathering, and model sharing!
