# Masakhane Meeting Notes: 28/05/2020

● Time: 19:00

● Number of Attendees: 19

● Notes taken by Lerato Louis

# Introduction

● Jade introduces the meeting, attributing her current state (exhaustion) to the EMNLP paper she’s been writing, which will 
be due for submission soon, She then lays out the structure, typical of all meetings, for those who may be new to the group (Masakhane). That typical structure being:

    ○ A brief overview of where everyone is at on the project, with any major or general highlights they may have picked up on. 
   
    ○ This is then followed by updates from each running initiative. Initiative updates tend to start with data set creation, 
    moving to any other aspect of any of the initiative, or any of the other initiatives currently running. 
    This also affords those leading the initiatives to have their say.
    
    ○ Open floor and/or discuss of any issues that may be need attention.
    
 Jade then reemphasizes the underlying goal, which is to run the group (Masakhane) more democratically, 
reminding everyone to visit and use Masakhane’s GitHub Meeting Agenda.The goal with the Agenda, is to ensure we’re capturing all 
the pressing topics and finding solutions. She thanks Hade and Kelechi for making sure this is happening and for overseeing it.

 She also encourages people to visit Masakhane’s Community page, to figure out where to go and where to find 
resources/ mentors/ volunteers.

 Timi suggests that people update their Slack profiles, listing stuff about themselves, so it’ll be easier to know about them, 
areas they’d be able to help in  and their areas of expertise.

# Project / Initiative Overview

 David - (as someone working a data initiative - Entity Recognition - and as someone working on our second task, NER) 
steps forward, with his project overview. Since last week, he now has 12 volunteers from Nigeria; 2 from Ethiopia; 
2 from Benin Republic; 1 from Egypt; 1 from Kenya and 1 from Lesotho. 
David has also created a small guide (https://github.com/masakhane-io/masakhane-community/blob/master/dataset-creation-guidelines.md) 
meant to assist with data set creation. He also invited the volunteers  to focus more crawling the different data sets they 
have and sending those through to him. He’s asked that there be a focus on data and annotation quality. 
He will be creating an NER channel on Slack soon. Tosin then asked which standard NER tags we were basing these on.
To which David replied CoNLL minus MISC, expanding on his choice.

 Julia - introduces her initiative, which is essentially taking our (Masakhane’s) benchmark models and applying them to data 
domains that don’t have translations yet, to gauge their models performance. One of the domains she’s chosen being a COVID survey. 
She then touches on post editing (which helps evaluate translation quality in a number of ways). She then gives us a brief look into 
her paper. Which we should be able to hyperlink after the EMNLP conference. 

 Timi & Jade - Have started using African content (songs specifically) to use as benchmarks.
The goal now is to have everyone else look for their favourite African songs and find translations (if they don’t exist, create them).

 Wale - Has been working on the Fulani language with Allen, hoping to do unsupervised NMT. They’ve already scraped a lot of 
data from news websites, Senegal, Nigeria and a few other African countries. They currently have about 100 000 sentences. 
They also have parallel tested data (one from the UN Human Rights commission) and 300 parallel data from Opus. 

# Project and Paper Updates

● Jade - Briefly takes us through the paper she’s written for the EMNLP conference. 
She’d spent time, figuring out how to adequately explain what Masakhane is, why it exists and is necessary and highlight its agility.
In the process,she found ICT Africa’s work, where one of the talks was on participatory research. Participatory research 
actually perfectly defines what Masakhane is and does.

# Other notes

 Masakhane now has a YouTube channel! Content coming soon.
 Vukosi - His research group has $9000 that it can afford to share with any members of Masakhani, in need of research credits. 

Then Lerato stopped taking notes, but if anyone can help expand these, that would be useful.
